                        I'm Darren! I am a college student who want to make a living out of coding. I am 20 years old at
                        the
                        time I wrote this and my hobbies
                        include anything that lets me hang out with friends or meet new people. In my personal time I
                        enjoy
                        playing video-games or spending time
                        with friends or my significant other. I am friendly and easy to get along with and can adapt
                        well in
                        new
                        environments!

                        <header>Why did I make this page?</header>
                        <br />
                        This page will hopefully showcase my future projects that I will work on or create in order to
                        give
                        employers an idea of
                        whether or not I have the skills they are looking for. Currently I am not very far into my
                        education
                        for
                        coding, as a result this page
                        will probably be very lacking in content for now.
