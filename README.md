# ProfessionalPortfolio
Homework for Boot Camp

# Info
This project is my professional portfolio. Its purpose is to showcase my abilties in coding while providing my "past" projects.
Currently, I do not have any projects I have created in the past so my "Work" section is empty, with only the template being made.
    Eventually I do plan to add a background image for a deployable link to my future projects while making the section a hyperlink.

# Faults/To-Do
I was unable to properly make this webpage compatible with all devices. Currently it is best viewed on a screen with 1960px width.
    I found that trying to get all the divs and sections to interact properly was too difficult for my time available. Additionally
    I had tried to impliment the @media function too late into the project and found that I needed to reformat a lot of sections in order
    to get the desired affect.
