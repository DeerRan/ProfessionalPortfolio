# ProfessionalPortfolio
Homework for Boot Camp

# Info
This project is my professional portfolio. Its purpose is to showcase my abilties in coding while providing my "past" projects.
Currently, I do not have any projects I have created in the past so my "Work" section is empty, with only the template being made.
    Eventually I do plan to add a background image for a deployable link to my future projects while making the section a hyperlink.

# Faults/To-Do
I was unable to properly make this webpage compatible with all devices. Currently it is best viewed on a screen with 1960px width.
    I found that trying to get all the divs and sections to interact properly was too difficult for my time available. Additionally
    I had tried to impliment the @media function too late into the project and found that I needed to reformat a lot of sections in order
    to get the desired affect. (I also did not understand a lot of what was going on when shifting the widths)
Additionally I discovered that clicking the deployable link for my index.html file through github does not properly display the my self image.
    Not too sure if that is an issue ony my end or not. I believe it is due to the fact that within the html, the image source is from the folder, but through 
    github it gets confused.
